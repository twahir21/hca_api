Short answer first:
## NOWDAYS BOTS DO SEARCH AND ATTACKS VIA AUTOMATIONS

* Bots are often used to find servers that allow `ssh username@ip` + password.
* It‚Äôs **relatively easy** for attackers to find servers that allow `ssh username@ip` + password ‚Äî opportunistic mass-scans happen constantly.
* Using a connection pooler **without a password** can be safe *only* if the pooler is locked down to local sockets and strict filesystem permissions; otherwise it‚Äôs risky.
* **Redis without a password** is risky if it‚Äôs reachable by attackers (network-exposed). On localhost-only setups it‚Äôs lower risk but still not ideal.
* A `.env` file that‚Äôs world-readable is **risky** ‚Äî attackers who gain access to the service account or can read files can steal secrets.
* If an attacker already has sufficient privileges on the box, **yes** they can change file ownership/permissions (including `.env`) and make themselves the owner or make it readable. Privilege escalation paths make this the main danger.

Now the detailed explanation and practical hardening steps.

---

# 1) How easy is it to find servers using password SSH?

* **Very common.** Internet-wide scanners and bots probe ranges of IPs for open port 22 (or other SSH ports) and try password logins or credential stuffing. Many compromises begin with weak/ reused passwords or enabled password auth.
* **Why this matters:** If you allow password auth, you expose an easy attack vector. Keys + passphrase are far stronger.

**Mitigation (strongly recommended):**

* Disable password auth in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

  ```
  PasswordAuthentication no
  PermitRootLogin no
  PubkeyAuthentication yes
  ```

  `sudo systemctl restart sshd`
* Use SSH keys (with passphrases) and `ssh-agent` or hardware keys.
* Use `AllowUsers` or `AllowGroups` to restrict logins.
* Use Fail2ban or similar to block repeated attempts.
* Restrict SSH by IP where possible (cloud security group / firewall).

---

# 2) Connection poolers (pgBouncer) without password

* If pgBouncer listens on a **network interface** with no auth, anyone who can reach that port can use it. That‚Äôs dangerous.
* If it listens on a **local UNIX socket** and socket file permissions are strict (only the DB-using service user can read/write), that is much safer ‚Äî but only if the server itself is not compromised.

**Recommendations:**

* Use `auth_type = md5` (or `scram-sha-256`) in pgbouncer and maintain an `auth_file`. Don‚Äôt leave it plaintext accessible to everyone.
* Prefer UNIX sockets for local-only connections and ensure socket ownership/mode restricts access.
* Use `listen_addr = 127.0.0.1` (or a private VPC/IP) and firewall off external access.
* Limit which DB roles can connect and use strong passwords for DB users.
* Configure PostgreSQL `pg_hba.conf` to restrict allowed hosts and methods.

---

# 3) Redis without password

* Redis exposed to the network with no auth is **very risky** ‚Äî attackers frequently target exposed Redis instances to exploit or to load malware (ransomware, cryptominers).
* If Redis is bound to `127.0.0.1` only and only local services access it, risk is lower ‚Äî but local compromise still exposes it.

**Hardening Redis:**

* In `redis.conf`:

  ```
  bind 127.0.0.1
  protected-mode yes
  requirepass <strong-password-or-better-use-ACLs>
  ```
* For Redis ‚â•6 use ACLs to create users with limited commands and keys.
* Use TLS if you must expose Redis over a network.
* Use firewall rules to block external access to Redis port (6379).
* Prefer Unix socket + filesystem permissions when possible and sensible.

---

# 4) `.env` file permissions and risk

* A readable `.env` file containing secrets is a single point of failure.
* Set strict ownership and permissions so only the service user (and root) can read it:

  ```
  sudo chown myserviceuser:myservicegroup /path/to/.env
  sudo chmod 600 /path/to/.env
  ```
* Better: keep secrets in a secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, cloud secrets, AWS SSM Parameter Store, etc.), or pass env vars via systemd service files rather than a world-readable file.

**Extra protections:**

* Mark file immutable if useful: `sudo chattr +i /path/to/.env` (note: root can undo it).
* Put the file outside webroot so it cannot be served by a misconfigured webserver.
* Do not check `.env` into git.

---

# 5) If a hacker gets in, can they change `.env` permissions?

* **Yes**, if they have an account with permissions to modify that file (owner or root). Even if the file is `600`, if the attacker has compromised the service user or gained sudo/root, they can change it.
* **Privilege escalation**: many attackers start as an unprivileged account and look for misconfigured SUID binaries, outdated kernels, or weak sudo rules to escalate to root.

**Mitigation:**

* Use least privilege: run services under dedicated users with minimal permissions.
* Keep system packages updated and apply security patches.
* Use AppArmor/SELinux to constrain services.
* Limit sudo privileges tightly (`/etc/sudoers`).
* Monitor `auth.log`/`journalctl`, unexpected processes, new users, or suspicious crontabs.

---

# 6) Detection & response (signs of compromise)

Watch for:

* Unexpected SSH logins or failures: `sudo tail -n 200 /var/log/auth.log`
* New users/groups, modified crontabs, unknown processes: `ps aux --sort=start_time`
* Outbound connections from unusual processes or high network usage.
* File modifications to /etc, web root, or binary locations.

If you suspect compromise:

1. Isolate the host from network (take it offline) if possible.
2. Preserve logs and memory (for forensics).
3. Rotate all credentials that might be exposed (DB passwords, API keys, SSH keys).
4. Rebuild from a known-good image if you cannot be certain of rootkit removal.
5. Notify stakeholders, follow incident response plan.

---

# 7) Useful commands (for hardening & checking)

Check listening sockets:

```bash
ss -tuln
# or
sudo lsof -i -P -n
```

Harden SSH:

```bash
sudo sed -i -e 's/^#PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' \
            -e 's/^#PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication no/' \
            /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Lock `.env`:

```bash
sudo chown myserviceuser:myservicegroup /srv/myapp/.env
sudo chmod 600 /srv/myapp/.env
```

Basic UFW example:

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow from <your-ip> to any port 22 proto tcp   # admin IPs only
sudo ufw allow 80,443/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

Redis: in `/etc/redis/redis.conf` set:

```
bind 127.0.0.1
protected-mode yes
requirepass "very-strong-password"
```

pgBouncer: configure `auth_type = md5` and restrict `listen_addr` and socket directory perms.

---

# 8) Practical risk summary

* **Password SSH:** medium‚Äìhigh risk if enabled and passwords are weak ‚Äî disable it.
* **pgBouncer without password:** low risk only if strictly local socket + strict perms; high risk if network-exposed.
* **Redis without password:** medium‚Äìhigh risk if network-exposed; less risk if localhost-only but still not ideal.
* **.env world-readable:** high risk. Fix file ownership/permissions or move secrets to a vault.
* **Can attacker change `.env` permissions?** Yes if they already control an account with sufficient privileges (or escalate). Hardening reduces the chance they get that far.

If you want, I can:

* Review your SSH/ufw/pgbouncer/redis config files (paste them here) and point out exact lines to change, or
* Produce a short checklist or `ansible`/`bash` script to harden a fresh Ubuntu VPS (SSH keys, ufw, fail2ban, redis/pgbouncer configs, file perms).

Which would help you most right now?

These logs are showing **brute-force SSH login attempts** against your server. Attackers (usually bots) are trying random usernames like `sergey`, `qsecofr`, `vyatta`, `sahil`, `root`, etc., from multiple IP addresses (e.g., `45.140.17.124`, `103.172.204.83`, `176.65.149.170`).

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in your logs:

* **Invalid user attempts**:

  ```
  Invalid user sergey from 45.140.17.124
  Failed password for invalid user sergey
  ```

  ‚Üí Bot tries a username that doesn‚Äôt exist.

* **Root login attempts**:

  ```
  Failed password for root from 222.76.149.131
  ```

  ‚Üí Bots often target `root`, since many admins forget to disable it.

* **High frequency**:
  Many attempts per minute from the same or different IPs = automated scans.

---

### Immediate Actions

1. **Disable root SSH login**
   In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

   ```
   PermitRootLogin no
   ```

   Then restart SSH:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

2. **Use key-based authentication only**
   Disable password logins:

   ```
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```

   Keep only `PubkeyAuthentication yes`.

3. **Change default SSH port** (not a fix, but reduces noise)

   ```
   Port 2222
   ```

4. **Firewall rules** (using `ufw` or `iptables`)
   Allow SSH only from trusted IPs, e.g.:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow from YOUR_IP to any port 22
   sudo ufw deny 22
   ```

5. **Install Fail2Ban** (auto-block repeated offenders)

   ```bash
   sudo apt install fail2ban
   ```

6. **Monitor logs in real time**

   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
   ```

---

‚úÖ If your server **already uses SSH keys and root login is disabled**, then these brute-force attempts are just noise ‚Äî they will fail.
‚ö†Ô∏è If you still allow passwords, you‚Äôre at **high risk** of compromise.

Do you want me to write you a **step-by-step hardened SSH setup** (with copy-paste config snippets) so these bots can never break in?

Good curiosity üôÇ I‚Äôll answer in a **safe / educational way** so you understand what‚Äôs going on, without giving you anything that could be used to attack others.

## üîé How SSH brute-force bots are usually built

1. **Scanning**

   * They run internet-wide port scans (using tools like `zmap`, `masscan`, or custom code) to find servers with port `22/tcp` open.
   * The bot records IPs that respond to an SSH handshake.

2. **Login attempts**

   * They use a simple SSH client library (Python‚Äôs `paramiko`, Go‚Äôs `crypto/ssh`, C‚Äôs `libssh`, etc.) or just call `ssh` directly in a script.
   * They iterate over a username/password list (‚Äúdictionary attack‚Äù) ‚Äî e.g. `root:root`, `admin:1234`, `user:password`.

3. **Parallelization**

   * They try thousands of servers at once, usually distributed across many compromised machines or rented servers.
   * If too many attempts fail, they rotate IPs to avoid blocks.

4. **Persistence / payload**

   * If login works, they install malware: crypto-miners, spam relays, or backdoors.
   * Often they immediately add their SSH keys and disable others to lock you out.

---

## üîß How they *test* servers

* They don‚Äôt ‚Äútest‚Äù in the sense of doing careful analysis ‚Äî they just **throw credentials** until one works or until they get blocked.
* Tools like **Hydra** (`hydra -l root -P wordlist.txt ssh://IP`) or **Medusa** do this automatically.
* Attackers automate it across millions of IPs; it‚Äôs a numbers game, not targeted.

---

## üß™ How you can *safely* test **your own server**

Since this is *your VPS*, you can do penetration testing ‚Äî but stick to ethical tools:

1. **Check brute-force resistance**

   * Run [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) **only against your own server**:

     ```bash
     hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://your.ip.address
     ```

     This simulates what the bots are doing.

2. **Test for open ports**

   * Run `nmap`:

     ```bash
     nmap -p 22 your.ip.address
     ```

     If port 22 is open, attackers see it too.

3. **Check logs**

   * While testing, tail your logs:

     ```bash
     sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
     ```

     You‚Äôll see your own attempts logged just like the bots‚Äô.

4. **Verify hardening**

   * If you disabled password login in SSH (`PasswordAuthentication no`), then Hydra should fail immediately.
   * If `PermitRootLogin no`, then even `root` user will not be accepted.

---

## üö® Big Warning

* Running brute-force tools **against any server that isn‚Äôt 100% yours** is illegal hacking.
* But doing it against your own VPS = ‚úÖ good practice (penetration testing).
* If you want safer testing, set up a **local VM** (VirtualBox, Docker, or multipass) and test there instead of the production VPS.

---

üëâ Do you want me to write you a **‚Äútest plan‚Äù** (step-by-step Hydra + nmap commands and expected log outputs) so you can practice safely against your VPS without breaking it?

Nice — big topic but fun. I’ll give a practical, opinionated, no-fluff survey: **when to use Postgres / MongoDB / Redis**, architecture patterns (small → massive), alternatives to consider, concrete strategies for massive reads/writes, caching & replication patterns, and a short “starter architecture” you can copy and evolve.

---

# Short summary (if you only read one thing)

* **Postgres**: go-to for transactional, relational data, complex queries, ACID. Best for most web apps.
* **MongoDB**: document DB for flexible schemas, rapid iteration, complex nested data — but not ideal for massive linear write workloads at scale unless designed carefully.
* **Redis**: in-memory data store — best as cache, ephemeral storage, real-time counters, queues/streams. Not a primary durable store for most systems (unless using Redis Enterprise with durability).
* For **massive write/read scale**, prefer **event-driven ingestion (Kafka)** + **append-first storage** + specialized DBs (Cassandra / DynamoDB / CockroachDB / ClickHouse) depending on access patterns.
* Use **cache-aside** (Redis) + **read replicas** + **sharding/partitioning** + **queueing for bursts** + **CDC** for analytics. Embrace eventual consistency for throughput.

# When to use each (detailed)

### Postgres (relational SQL)

Use it when:

* You need **ACID transactions**, joins, foreign keys, complex queries, or SQL analytics.
* You want a proven, feature-rich RDBMS with strong tooling (migrations, extensions).
  Strengths:
* Great consistency, indexing, and complex queries.
* Extensions: JSONB (semi-structured), full-text, PostGIS, logical replication.
  Limitations:
* Vertical scaling by default; horizontal scale needs read-replicas, partitioning, or distributed SQL (CockroachDB, Yugabyte, or Citus/Azure Hyperscale).
  Good for:
* E-commerce, banking, user accounts, relational business logic.

### MongoDB (document/NoSQL)

Use it when:

* Schema is **flexible** or evolving and documents map naturally to your domain.
* You need fast development and complex nested objects without rigid joins.
  Strengths:
* Flexible documents, good replication and sharding built-in.
  Limitations:
* Transactions exist but historically weaker/less natural than relational. For massive global scale, careful partitioning/sharding required.
  Good for:
* Content management, product catalogs with variable attributes, prototyping APIs.

### Redis (in-memory key-value / data structures)

Use it when:

* You need **extremely low-latency** access (caching), counters, rate-limiting, session stores, leaderboards, pub/sub, or stream processing.
  Strengths:
* Sub-millisecond reads/writes, rich data structures, simple primitives for real-time features.
  Limitations:
* Memory cost; durability depends on config or enterprise edition. Not ideal as sole durable source unless configured for persistence/replication.
  Good for:
* Caching hot results, session data, real-time analytics, message queues (Redis Streams).

# When to use all (polyglot persistence)

Most production systems use multiple databases — each for the thing it does best:

* **Postgres**: primary transactional store (users, orders).
* **Redis**: cache hot reads, sessions, counters.
* **MongoDB**: optional for document-heavy features (if you need it).
* **Kafka / SQS**: buffer incoming writes and feed downstream systems.
* **Cassandra, DynamoDB, or CockroachDB**: for ultra-high throughput, multi-region, or write-heavy telemetry.

---

# Modern architectures for massive scale — patterns & examples

### 1) General web app (high traffic reads, moderate writes)

API → LB → App servers
App servers:

* **Cache-aside** with Redis for hot reads: check Redis → on miss read from Postgres → write Redis.
* Postgres primary for writes → read replicas for heavy read traffic.
* Use connection pooling (PgBouncer) to handle many app instances.

Why this is good:

* Simple, predictable, transactional integrity on writes.
* Reads scaled horizontally with replicas + caching.

### 2) High ingestion (telemetry, logs, analytics) — write-heavy

Client → LB → Ingest/Collector → **Kafka** (or Pulsar)
Consumers:

* Real-time consumers write to **Cassandra / DynamoDB** (for fast writes and partitioned read), and also to **ClickHouse** or **S3 + Parquet** for analytics.
* Materialized views / OLAP in ClickHouse / BigQuery for reporting.
* Redis for short-term aggregation and counters.

Why:

* Kafka buffers bursts and enables replay. Cassandra/Dynamo handles enormous write rates with predictable latency.

### 3) Globally distributed transactional system

API → Edge → App Servers → **Distributed SQL** (CockroachDB / Yugabyte) OR regional Postgres w/ sharding

* Use multi-region distributed SQL if you need global serializable transactions and single logical DB.
* Use per-region Postgres + async replication + conflict resolution if eventual consistency is acceptable.

### 4) Real-time features + search

* **Redis** for real-time counters/leaderboards.
* **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch** for full-text search and aggregated queries.
* Keep canonical data in Postgres (or document DB), index into ES via CDC (Debezium) or message bus.

# Concrete strategies to win scaling without headaches

### A) Avoid hammering the primary DB: use queues for writes

* Push incoming writes into **Kafka** or a durable queue.
* Worker pool consumes at controlled rates and writes to DB (batching writes if possible).
* This smooths spikes and allows retries/backpressure.

### B) Cache smartly: cache-aside (recommended) vs write-behind

* **Cache-aside**: App checks cache → on miss, query DB → populate cache. Simple and safe.
* **Write-through / write-behind**: writes go to cache and asynchronously to DB — increases complexity and data-loss risk. Use only if you understand the trade-offs.
  => **Start with cache-aside**.

### C) Read replicas for scaling reads

* Use read replicas for read-heavy loads; be mindful of replica lag for recently-written data.
* For strong consistency reads (just after writes), read from primary or use explicit cache invalidation.

### D) Sharding / partitioning

* Use logical partition keys that match query patterns (time, tenant, region).
* For Postgres: use table partitioning (range or list) and partition-wise parallelism. For horizontal scaling use Citus or distributed SQL.
* For NoSQL: choose partition key carefully to avoid hot partitions.

### E) Use CDC for cross-system sync

* Capture DB changes (Debezium or DB native logical replication) and stream them into search indexes, caches, data warehouses and caches.
* Keeps analytic stores eventual-consistent and decoupled.

### F) Batching and bulk operations

* Batch inserts/updates when possible to reduce per-row overhead. Single big transaction beats many small transactions.

### G) Idempotency & retries

* Make ingestion idempotent (dedupe on idempotency key) so retries are safe. Essential with queues.

### H) Connection management & pooling

* RDBMSs have connection limits; use PgBouncer / ProxySQL to pool connections. For serverless app instances, avoid N×DB connections explosion.

### I) Observability & autoscaling

* Monitor latency, queue lengths, replica lag, CPU/memory. Autoscale app workers based on queue/backlog metrics, not just CPU.

# Practical recommended stacks (by use-case)

1. **Most web apps (read-heavy, transactional):**

   * Postgres primary + read replicas
   * Redis (cache-aside)
   * Kafka or Redis Streams for background jobs
   * Elasticsearch for search
   * Managed services (RDS/Aurora, Redis Enterprise)

2. **Write-heavy telemetry/metrics:**

   * Kafka for ingestion
   * Cassandra / DynamoDB for write scale and wide availability
   * ClickHouse for analytics & reporting
   * S3 for raw cold storage

3. **Global low-latency transactional app:**

   * CockroachDB or Yugabyte (distributed SQL)
   * Redis for local caching
   * CDN + edge logic for static and session handling

---

# Specific trade-offs: Read replicas vs Redis-first then sync

* **Read replicas**:

  * Pros: Simple; read scaling without cache complexity.
  * Cons: Replica lag; still requires DB queries per miss; less latency improvement than memory cache.
* **Redis-first (cache-aside)**:

  * Pros: Fastest read latency, reduces DB load a lot for hot reads.
  * Cons: Cache invalidation complexity, memory cost, cache warm-up.
* **Best practice**: Use **both** — Redis for hot data and read replicas for broad read scaling. Use cache for heavy-read endpoints and replicas for other reads.

---

# Short implementation examples / pseudo-code

### Cache-aside (Node/TS)

```ts
// read
async function getUser(id) {
  const cacheKey = `user:${id}`;
  const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

  const user = await pg.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=$1', [id]);
  if (user) {
    await redis.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(user), { EX: 60 }); // TTL
  }
  return user;
}

// write (invalidate cache)
async function updateUser(id, data) {
  await pg.query('UPDATE users SET ... WHERE id=$1', [id]);
  await redis.del(`user:${id}`);
}
```

### Queue + batch write (pseudo)

```
client -> API -> produce message to Kafka topic `writes`
worker(s) -> consume from `writes` -> batch messages (200) -> insert batch into DB (single transaction)
```

---

# Operational tips (don’t forget these)

* Use **managed services** if you can (RDS/Aurora, Mongo Atlas, DynamoDB, Redis Enterprise) — saves ops headaches.
* **Backups** and **point-in-time recovery** are critical.
* **Schema migrations**: plan and roll out backwards-compatible changes (deploy code, migrate data, switch).
* **Test failover** and replica promotion periodically.
* Set realistic **SLA**/consistency expectations (know when eventual consistency is acceptable).

# Quick decision flow (pick under pressure)

1. Need transactions/joins? → **Postgres** (or distributed SQL if global scale required).
2. Flexible JSON docs and rapid dev? → **MongoDB**.
3. Need microsecond reads, counters, sessions, pub/sub? → **Redis** (cache + streams).
4. Massive write throughput / time-series / telemetry? → **Kafka + Cassandra/DynamoDB + ClickHouse**.
5. Want to avoid operational DB scaling headaches? → **Use managed cloud DBs** (Aurora, DynamoDB, MongoDB Atlas, Redis Cloud).

---

If you like, I can:

* Sketch a **concrete architecture** for your app (tell me expected QPS, read/write ratio, global vs single region, data size).
* Provide **code samples** for cache-aside + read-replicas + CDC to sync to Elasticsearch / ClickHouse.
* Suggest **cost/ops tradeoffs** between managed vs self-hosted for your scale.

Which would you like next?

Yes, what you’re describing is essentially a **write-behind caching pattern** (also called **asynchronous write-back**). It’s practical in certain cases, but there are some important considerations, especially when scalability and massive writes are involved. Let’s break it down.

---

### **1. How your approach works**

* **Writes go to Redis first:**

  * Fast, in-memory writes → minimal latency for users.
* **Background sync to Postgres:**

  * During low traffic or via scheduled jobs → persist data reliably.
* **Delete from Redis after successful write:**

  * Keeps Redis memory usage bounded.

✅ Advantages:

* Extremely fast for write-heavy operations.
* Can handle bursty traffic since Redis is in-memory.
* Reduces load on Postgres during peak times.

⚠️ Disadvantages / Risks:

* **Data loss risk** if Redis crashes before syncing to Postgres.
* Complexity in handling **failures during sync**.
* **Memory management:** Large volume of unsynced writes may exhaust Redis memory.
* Ordering / consistency issues if multiple writes update the same key.

---

### **2. Scaling this approach**

For **massive writes**, you’ll want a more robust and scalable design:

#### **Option A: Use a queue between Redis and Postgres**

Instead of syncing directly from Redis → Postgres in low traffic:

1. Write to Redis **and a durable queue** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, etc.).
2. Background workers consume from the queue → write to Postgres.
3. Delete from Redis only after successful Postgres write.

**Benefits:**

* No data loss (queue is persistent).
* Can horizontally scale workers for high throughput.
* Retry logic for failed writes is easier.

---

#### **Option B: Redis streams / append-only logs**

* Use **Redis Streams** or **List** to append incoming writes.
* Background process reads the stream → writes to Postgres.
* This preserves order and allows multiple consumers for scaling.

---

#### **Option C: Batch writes to Postgres**

* Collect writes in Redis, then write in **bulk / batch** → Postgres (1000s of rows at once).
* Reduces number of transactions, improves throughput.
* Works well with Option A or B.

---

### **3. Reliability considerations**

* **Persistence in Redis:** Use **AOF (Append Only File)** so writes are not lost on crash.
* **Monitoring memory usage:** Redis can OOM if traffic spikes and data is huge.
* **Idempotency:** Ensure Postgres writes can handle retries without duplicates.

---

### **4. Summary / Practical Advice**

* For **moderate writes**, your approach works fine.
* For **massive writes**, use Redis as a **fast buffer**, but always combine with:

  * Persistent queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ) or Redis Streams.
  * Batch writes to Postgres.
  * Idempotent operations.
* This gives **scalable, fault-tolerant write-behind architecture**.

If you want, I can draw a **diagram showing a scalable architecture for massive writes using Redis + Queue + Postgres** — it makes the flow much clearer. Do you want me to do that?

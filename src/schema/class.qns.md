Excellent question again 🔥 — this is exactly how a **good data model** proves its value: by supporting clear, meaningful **real-world questions**.

Since your schema is relationally rich (especially with the **3-way junction** `teacher_subject_class_table`), you can answer a *lot* of queries easily and accurately.

---

## 🧩 Recap of Schema

You have:

```ts
TeachersTable(id, name, phone)
SubjectsTable(id, name)
ClassesTable(id, name)
TeacherSubjectClassTable(teacherId, subjectId, classId)
```

Each record in `TeacherSubjectClassTable` means:

> “Teacher X teaches Subject Y in Class Z.”

## 🧠 All Possible Real-World Questions (with examples)

Here’s a structured list of **everything your schema can answer** grouped by use-case:

---

### 🧍‍♂️ **Teacher-based queries**

1. **What subjects does Mr. John teach (in any class)?**
   → “Show all subjects where teacherId = John’s id.”

2. **What classes does Mr. John teach (regardless of subject)?**
   → “List all class names linked to John.”

3. **In which class does Mr. John teach Mathematics?**
   → Filter by teacherId = John and subject = Math.

4. **What subject does Mr. John teach in Form 1?**
   → Filter by teacherId = John and class = Form 1.

5. **How many subjects does Mr. John teach in total?**
   → Count distinct subjectIds for John.

6. **How many classes does Mr. John handle in total?**
   → Count distinct classIds for John.

7. **Show all (subject, class) pairs for Mr. John.**
   → List every teaching assignment for that teacher.

### 📘 **Subject-based queries**

8. **Which teachers teach Mathematics?**
   → Filter by subjectId = Math.

9. **In which classes is Mathematics taught?**
   → Filter by subjectId = Math → get class names.

10. **Who teaches Mathematics in Form 1?**
    → Filter by subject = Math and class = Form 1.

11. **How many teachers teach Mathematics across the school?**
    → Count distinct teacherIds for subject = Math.

12. **List all teachers and their classes that teach Mathematics.**
    → subject = Math → join with teachers and classes.

---

### 🏫 **Class-based queries**

13. **What subjects are taught in Form 1?**
    → Filter by classId = Form 1 → get subjects.

14. **Who teaches in Form 1 (any subject)?**
    → Filter by classId = Form 1 → get teachers.

15. **Who teaches Mathematics in Form 1?**
    → Filter by classId = Form 1 and subject = Math.

16. **How many teachers teach in Form 1?**
    → Count distinct teacherIds for class = Form 1.

17. **How many subjects are offered in Form 1?**
    → Count distinct subjectIds for class = Form 1.

---

### 🧮 **Cross-summary / analytics**

18. **How many classes does each teacher handle?**
    → Group by teacherId, count distinct classIds.

19. **How many subjects does each teacher teach?**
    → Group by teacherId, count distinct subjectIds.

20. **How many teachers per subject?**
    → Group by subjectId, count distinct teacherIds.

21. **How many teachers per class?**
    → Group by classId, count distinct teacherIds.

22. **Show timetable-like matrix: Teacher × Class × Subject.**

23. **Which teacher handles the most classes?**
    → Order by count(classId) desc.

24. **Which subject is taught by the most teachers?**
    → Group by subject, count teachers.

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Advanced administrative queries**

25. **Are there subjects with no assigned teacher?**
    → Left-join subjects → teacher_subject_class_table → check null.

26. **Are there classes with missing subjects?**
    → Left-join classes → teacher_subject_class_table → check null.

27. **List all teachers without any assignments yet.**

28. **List all subjects taught by more than one teacher in the same class.**

29. **Which classes have multiple teachers teaching the same subject?**

30. **Does every subject have at least one teacher?**

---

### 🔄 **Optional if you add mentoring table**

31. **Who is the class mentor for Form 1?**
32. **Which classes is Mr. John mentoring (not teaching)?**
